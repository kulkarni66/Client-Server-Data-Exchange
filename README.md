# Client-Server Data Exchange
 
Description of the project: 
                           - Client-Server Data Exchange using Java sockets.

Instructions for running the code: 
                                  - Compile and run the server and client programs separately.
                                  - Open the cmd or win powershell and run the server file and open another cmd or powershell file and run client file.
                                  - The server listens on port 6600, and the client connects to the server at localhost on the same port.

Explanation of the server and client code: 
                                          - Briefly describe how the server handles multiple clients simultaneously, the choice of TCP protocol, and network error                                              handling in both the client and server.

Any additional notes or dependencies required to run the code.
